RESPONSE TO PREVIOUS REVIEW FEEDBACK

Dear Apple Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback. We have addressed both issues:

1. GUIDELINE 2.1 - BUSINESS MODEL CLARIFICATION:

This is a B2B (Business-to-Business) logistics management application 
designed exclusively for business users managing delivery operations.

Key Points:
‚Ä¢ NO in-app purchases or subscriptions in the mobile app
‚Ä¢ All subscriptions purchased at https://nowshipping.co (our website)
‚Ä¢ Mobile app validates subscription status via API only
‚Ä¢ Qualifies for B2B exemption per App Store Guideline 3.1.3(b)
‚Ä¢ Multi-platform enterprise system (Web, iOS, Android, API)
‚Ä¢ Includes physical services (delivery logistics, not digital content)

Documentation:
- See in-app: Profile ‚Üí About ‚Üí "Business Application" section
- See in-app: Privacy Policy ‚Üí "Payment Information" section
- See in-app: Terms of Service ‚Üí "Subscriptions and Payments" section

All clearly explain our B2B business model and external payment processing.

2. CAMERA CRASH FIX (iPad Air issue):

Fixed the camera crash by adding required Info.plist keys:
‚Ä¢ NSCameraUsageDescription
‚Ä¢ NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription  
‚Ä¢ NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription

The app now:
‚Ä¢ Properly requests camera/photo permissions
‚Ä¢ Handles permission denials gracefully
‚Ä¢ Shows helpful messages when permissions are denied
‚Ä¢ Provides Settings link for users to grant permissions
‚Ä¢ No longer crashes when camera is selected

Tested on iPad Air (5th generation) and multiple iPhone models.
Camera and photo library access now work correctly without crashes.

## üö® IF REVIEW IS REJECTED AGAIN

### Common Follow-up Questions

**Q: "Where can users purchase subscriptions?"**
A: Reference APPLE_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md, Question 2. Point to in-app documentation and website.

**Q: "How does the app access subscription features?"**
A: The app makes API calls to nowshipping.co/api/v1, receives user's subscription tier in JWT token, and enables/disables features client-side based on tier.

**Q: "Why not use In-App Purchase?"**
A: This is a B2B app exempt under guideline 3.1.3(b). The subscription includes:
- Multi-platform access (Web, iOS, Android)
- Physical delivery services (not digital content)
- Enterprise billing requirements (invoices, POs, etc.)
- API access for business integrations

**Q: "Camera still crashes on our device"**
A: Request specific details:
- Device model and iOS version
- Exact steps to reproduce
- Crash logs
Then test on that specific configuration.

### Escalation Path
1. Respond professionally to feedback
2. Request specific clarification if unclear
3. Reference App Store Review Guidelines 3.1.3(b) for B2B exemption
4. Request phone call with App Review Board if needed
5. Provide additional documentation from APPLE_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md
