## Response to Apple

When resubmitting, include this message:

```
Dear Apple Review Team,

We have addressed both issues from the previous review:

1. GUIDELINE 2.1 - BUSINESS MODEL:
   We have updated our Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and About screens 
   to clearly explain our B2B business model. The app now explicitly states:
   - This is a B2B logistics platform (not consumer-facing)
   - All subscriptions are purchased on our website (nowshipping.co)
   - The app does NOT process any payments (qualifies for B2B exemption 3.1.3(b))
   - Features are validated via API based on website subscriptions
   
   Please see the in-app documentation under:
   - Profile → About (Business Model Notice)
   - Settings → Privacy Policy (Payment Information section)
   - Settings → Terms of Service (Subscriptions and Payments section)

2. CAMERA CRASH ON iPAD:
   Fixed by adding required Info.plist privacy keys:
   - NSCameraUsageDescription
   - NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
   - NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription
   
   The app now properly requests camera permissions and handles denials gracefully.
   See CAMERA_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md for technical details.

Build Version: 1.0.5 (Build 6)
Both issues have been thoroughly tested and resolved.

Thank you for your review.
```
