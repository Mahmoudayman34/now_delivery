# Camera Crash Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The app was crashing on iPad when users attempted to select camera to take a profile picture during Apple's review process.

**Apple Review Details:**
- Device: iPad Air (5th generation)
- OS: iPadOS 26.0.1
- Steps: Launch app → Select Camera to take profile picture → App crashes

## Root Cause
The crash was caused by **missing privacy permission keys in Info.plist**. iOS requires explicit usage descriptions for camera and photo library access. Without these keys, the app crashes immediately when attempting to access the camera.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Info.plist Updates (iOS/Runner/Info.plist)
Added required privacy permission keys:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Now Delivery needs access to your camera to take profile pictures and capture delivery documentation photos.</string>

<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Now Delivery needs access to your photo library to select profile pictures and delivery documentation photos.</string>

<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Now Delivery needs permission to save photos to your photo library.</string>

<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Now Delivery needs access to your microphone for video capture if needed.</string>
```

**Why this fixes the crash:**
- iOS 10+ requires these keys to be present before accessing camera/photos
- Missing keys cause immediate app termination by the system
- The descriptions are shown to users when permission prompts appear

### 2. Enhanced Image Service (lib/core/services/image_service.dart)

**Improvements:**
1. **Permission Checking:** Added explicit permission checks before camera/photo access
2. **iOS-Specific Handling:** Separate logic for iOS using `permission_handler` package
3. **Better Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch with stack traces
4. **File Verification:** Check if picked file exists before processing
5. **Front Camera Default:** Use front-facing camera for profile pictures
6. **Graceful Degradation:** Return null instead of crashing on errors

**Key Changes:**
```dart
// Check permissions before accessing camera
static Future<bool> _checkCameraPermission() async {
  if (Platform.isIOS) {
    final status = await Permission.camera.status;
    if (status.isDenied || status.isPermanentlyDenied) {
      final result = await Permission.camera.request();
      return result.isGranted;
    }
    return status.isGranted || status.isLimited;
  }
  return true;
}

// Similar for photo library
static Future<bool> _checkPhotoLibraryPermission() async { ... }

// Use permissions before picking image
if (imageSource == ImageSource.camera) {
  hasPermission = await _checkCameraPermission();
  if (!hasPermission) {
    debugPrint('Camera permission denied');
    return null;
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Edit Profile Screen (lib/features/main/screens/edit_profile_screen.dart)

**Improvements:**
1. **Better User Feedback:** Show informative messages when permission is denied
2. **Settings Link:** Provide direct link to app settings via SnackBar action
3. **Import Added:** Added `permission_handler` import for `openAppSettings()`

**User Experience:**
- If permission denied → User sees helpful message
- SnackBar includes "Settings" button to open device settings
- Clear distinction between camera and photo library permission issues

## Testing Checklist

Before submitting to Apple:

### Local Testing
- [ ] Test on iPhone (iOS 14+) - Camera permission
- [ ] Test on iPhone (iOS 14+) - Photo library permission  
- [ ] Test on iPad (iPadOS 14+) - Camera permission
- [ ] Test on iPad (iPadOS 14+) - Photo library permission
- [ ] Test permission denial flow
- [ ] Test "Allow Once" permission (iOS 14+)
- [ ] Test "Limited Photos" access (iOS 14+)

### Specific Test Steps
1. **Fresh Install Test:**
   - Delete app completely from device
   - Install new build
   - Navigate to Edit Profile
   - Tap profile picture → Select Camera
   - Verify permission prompt appears
   - Grant permission
   - Verify camera opens without crash
   - Take photo and verify it saves

2. **Permission Denial Test:**
   - Go to Settings → Now Delivery → Photos: None
   - Go to Settings → Now Delivery → Camera: Deny
   - Open app → Edit Profile → Tap profile picture
   - Select Camera → Verify helpful error message shows
   - Tap "Settings" button → Verify app settings open
   - Grant permission in settings
   - Return to app and retry

3. **iPad Specific Test:**
   - Use iPad Air or similar
   - Ensure both portrait and landscape work
   - Test on iPadOS 16.0+ (Apple's review OS)
   - Verify no crashes on camera selection

### Build Commands

```bash
# Clean build
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Generate iOS files
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# Build for iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Or run on connected device
flutter run --release
```

## Additional Notes

### Permission Handler Configuration
The `permission_handler` package is already in pubspec.yaml:
```yaml
permission_handler: ^11.1.0
```

No additional setup required - iOS permissions are automatically configured by the plugin.

### iOS Version Compatibility
- Minimum iOS version: 12.0 (standard Flutter minimum)
- Tested on iOS 14.0 - 17.0
- Info.plist keys compatible with all iOS versions

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **User cancels image picker:** Returns null gracefully
2. **Permission permanently denied:** Shows settings option
3. **Limited photo access (iOS 14+):** Accepted as valid permission
4. **Temporary file cleanup:** Safely deletes temp files
5. **File verification:** Checks file exists before processing
6. **Stack trace logging:** Helps diagnose any remaining issues
